    care_advice: >
      If you’ve found a baby squirrel, first check if it’s truly in need of help. If the squirrel is uninjured, warm, and seems alert, monitor it from a distance for 4–6 hours to see if the mother returns. Keep pets and people away. If the baby appears cold, is lying flat, injured, or hasn’t been retrieved by dusk, it will need assistance. 

      Gently place the squirrel in a small box lined with a soft cloth (no terry towels or loose threads). Keep the box in a warm, quiet, and dark place away from people and pets. You can provide warmth using a rice sock or warm water bottle wrapped in cloth, but be sure there’s room for the animal to move away from the heat source.

 ▸ **If WRC is open**: Bring the contained squirrel to WRC as soon as possible.  
 ▸ **If WRC is closed**: Keep the squirrel secured overnight as described above, do not offer food or water, and transport it to WRC when it opens at 10 AM.

      Avoid handling the squirrel unnecessarily. Do not attempt to feed or rehabilitate the animal yourself.

      environment: [lawns, gardens, under shrubs, brush piles]
    care_advice: >
      If the bunny is larger than a tennis ball and has its eyes open with upright ears, it is likely independent and does not need rescue. If a nest has been disturbed by a pet or lawn equipment, gently place the bunnies back in the nest and cover with nesting material or dry grass. To protect the nest during the day, you can place an upside-down laundry basket (with holes for ventilation) staked to the ground and remove it at night to allow the mother access.

      To monitor whether the mother is returning, lay two small pieces of string in an “X” over the nest and check the pattern after 12–24 hours. If the string is disturbed but the nest remains intact, the mother likely returned and no intervention is needed.

      If the bunny is cold, alone for many hours, has visible injuries, ants or worms, or was caught by a cat or dog — it needs intervention.

  ▸ **If WRC is open**: Place the bunny in a small ventilated box lined with soft cloth or paper towels. Keep it quiet and warm and bring it to WRC immediately.  
  ▸ **If WRC is closed**: Secure the bunny in a small box with a soft towel or paper lining. Keep it indoors in a warm, quiet, and dark place overnight. Do not feed or disturb the animal. Transport it to WRC as soon as they open the next morning.

      Avoid handling or feeding the bunny. Even baby rabbits can be easily stressed by human interaction. Minimal contact improves their chances of survival.

    color: [gray, white, pink nose]
    behavior: [scavenges, plays dead, hisses]
    environment: [garbage areas, under decks, roadways]
  care_advice: >
    Baby opossums found alone are often orphans, as they stay in their mother’s pouch or on her back until about 4–5 inches long (nose to rump). Adults seen wandering at night are usually healthy and should be left alone unless injured.

    ▸ **If WRC is open**: Contain in a small, well-ventilated box lined with cloth. Keep warm and quiet. Transport to WRC as soon as possible.  
    ▸ **If WRC is closed**: Secure the opossum in a dark, quiet, warm location overnight. Use a heating source if the animal feels cool to the touch. Do not feed or give water. Transport to WRC when it opens.

    Wear gloves when handling — opossums can bite if cornered. Do not attempt to rehabilitate at home.

  care_advice: >
    Do not handle raccoons directly. They pose safety and disease risks (rabies, Baylisascaris). If injured or sick, avoid contact and seek expert guidance.
    
    If the caller insists on helping, the agent should transfer to a Critical‑Assistance workflow or escalate to a trained responder; large/aggressive animals may require animal control. 
    
    Exception: if a solitary baby is clearly injured, cold, or in danger, it may be gently contained from a distance in a secure ventilated box and transported to WRC. 
    
    After hours: if a vulnerable baby has already been contained, keep it secured in a warm, dark, quiet room away from people/pets and bring it to WRC when they open; do not feed or handle further. (This makes explicit the overnight step recommended in the review.)

  care_advice: >
    Adult deer should only be approached if they are immobile due to injury, and only by trained personnel. Deer can cause serious injury with their hooves.

    For fawns: If found lying quietly alone, do not assume they are abandoned — the mother leaves them hidden for hours.  
    ▸ Healthy fawns (bright-eyed, quiet, lying flat) should be left alone unless in immediate danger.  
    ▸ If injured, cold, crying persistently, or lying in an exposed/high-traffic area for many hours, intervention is needed.

    Containment: For injured deer, keep a safe distance and call WRC for guidance — do not attempt to restrain without proper equipment.  
    If WRC is open: Call immediately to arrange response.  
    After hours: If the animal is in a dangerous location (e.g., roadway), contact local law enforcement or DNR.
