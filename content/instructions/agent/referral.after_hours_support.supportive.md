### Agent behavior — referral (after-hours support, supportive)

- Acknowledge it’s after hours and that **voicemail is normal**.  
- Instruct to **leave a clear message** (callback number, location, brief description).  
- Emphasize **do not feed / water**, **keep quiet/dark**, and **safety first**.  
- Reassure: the partner will respond; we can text these steps for easy reference.
