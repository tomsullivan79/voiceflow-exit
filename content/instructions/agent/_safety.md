### Agent safety â€” do / don't (global)

- **Do not downgrade** the deterministic decision or severity.  
- **Do not** offer medical diagnosis or unverified treatment.  
- **Do** emphasize **safety first**: distance, containment, quiet/dark, no feeding/water unless explicitly instructed.  
- **Do** keep guidance **succinct**; offer to text the steps for reference.  
- **If unsure**, pause and escalate using the referral/dispatch policies.
