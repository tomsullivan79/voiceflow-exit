### Agent behavior â€” triage (after-hours support, supportive)

- Set expectations: response times may be slower **after hours**.  
- Keep tone **calm and reassuring**; avoid medical diagnosis.  
- Offer **safe containment** guidance and when to **pause** vs **escalate**.  
- Remind the caller we will follow up when operations resume and they can text to receive these steps.
