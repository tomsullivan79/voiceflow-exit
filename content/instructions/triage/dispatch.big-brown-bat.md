# Public Health — Do this now
- Do not touch the bat. Keep people and pets out of the room.
- If anyone was asleep in the room (or a child/elder/impaired person was present), treat as potential rabies exposure.
- If safe, close the door and seal gaps under it with a towel to confine the bat.
- If the bat is already in a box/container, keep it closed in a cool, low-traffic room.
- Call your local Public Health Department or Animal Control for testing and exposure guidance.
- If anyone had direct contact (bite/scratch): wash with soap and water for 15 minutes and seek medical care immediately.
- If advised to submit the bat for testing, follow their instructions for safe capture/transport—do not handle without guidance.
- **Incident location:** ZIP {{zip}} ({{county_name}} County).
