# Public Health â€” Do this now
- Do not touch the animal. Keep people and pets away.
- If a bat was in a room with a sleeping person or with a child/elder/impaired individual, treat as potential rabies exposure.
- Close interior doors and confine the area if safe to do so.
- If the animal is already contained (e.g., in a box), keep it closed and in a low-traffic room.
- Contact your local Public Health Department or Animal Control for exposure guidance and testing instructions.
- If anyone had direct contact, bite, or scratch: wash the area with soap and water for 15 minutes and seek medical care immediately.
- If advised to submit the animal for testing, follow their instructions for safe transport; do not attempt handling without guidance.
