### Supportive next steps for small mammals (squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks)

You’re doing the right thing. Small mammals stress easily—calm, quiet handling is key.

1) **Do not feed or give water**; incorrect feeding can cause harm.  
2) If the animal is contained, keep it **quiet, dark, and room-temperature**.  
3) If not contained, place a **ventilated box** over it to limit movement and stress.  
4) Keep people and pets **well away**.  
5) Contact the **recommended small-mammal partner** below for instructions and transport guidance.  
6) If anything feels unsafe, **step back and wait** for professional help.
