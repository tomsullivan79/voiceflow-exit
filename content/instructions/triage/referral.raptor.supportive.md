### Supportive next steps for raptors

You’re on the right track. Because this involves a **raptor**, specialized handling is important.

1) **Do not handle** the bird directly — talons and beaks can cause serious injury.  
2) If the bird is grounded and calm, place a **laundry basket or ventilated box** over it to limit stress.  
3) Keep pets and people **well away**; minimize noise and light.  
4) Contact the **recommended raptor partner** below for instructions and transport guidance.  
5) If anything feels unsafe, **step back and wait** for professional help.
