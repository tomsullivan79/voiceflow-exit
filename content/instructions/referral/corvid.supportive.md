### Supportive referral steps — corvids

You’re doing the right thing by asking for help. For crows, ravens, jays, and magpies, a **specialized partner** can provide the safest care.

1) Please **call the recommended corvid partner** as soon as you can.  
2) If there’s no answer, **leave a clear message** with your callback number and location.  
3) Keep the bird **quiet and contained** (dark, low noise) and **do not feed or give water**.  
4) If anything feels unsafe, **pause and wait** for instructions.
