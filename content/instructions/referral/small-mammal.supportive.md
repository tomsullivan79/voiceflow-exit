### Supportive referral steps — small mammals

You’re doing the right thing by asking for help. For squirrels, rabbits, and chipmunks, a **specialized partner** provides the safest care.

1) Please **call the recommended partner** as soon as you can.  
2) If there’s no answer, **leave a clear message** with your callback number and location.  
3) Keep the animal **quiet/dark/room-temperature**; **do not feed or give water**.  
4) If anything feels unsafe, **pause and wait** for instructions.
_Local context:_ ZIP **{{zip}}**, **{{county}}** ({{county_name}}).
