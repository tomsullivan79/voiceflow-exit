### We’re with you — supportive referral steps

You’re doing the right thing by asking for help. For this situation, a **specialized partner** can provide the fastest, safest care.

1) Please **call the recommended partner** as soon as you can.  
2) If no one picks up, **leave a clear message** with your callback number and the animal’s location.  
3) While you wait, keep the animal **quiet, dark, and room-temperature**, away from pets and children.  
4) If anything feels unsafe, **step back and wait for instructions**.

If you’d like, we can send these steps by text so you have them handy.
